                        <p>			
                        The East Africa Art Biennale Association (EASTAFAB) will showcase its 8th Biennale from November 2nd to 22nd 2017 in Dar es Salaam. After that date it will move on to the East African capitals of Arusha, Nairobi, Kampala, Kigali and Bujumbura. The exact dates for the exhibitions at these capitals will be communicated later. </p>
                        <p>
                        The Organizing Committee wishes to thank most sincerely the Arusha based <i>Incubator for Integration and Development in East Africa (IIDEA)</i> project affiliated to the GIZ for the generous support in this venture.  
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Since its establishment in 2003, the EASTAFAB has held all its Biennales in Dar es Salaam only; this will be the first time ever to have East African artworks move across borders, a good sign of cultural integration among the people of East Africa. We congratulate all artists who have responded positively to our call for the moving art across the East African borders project.      
                        </p>

                        <p>
